# Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

This repo is all about making deep learning fun, approachable, and understandable for everyone. We’re here to demystify the tech and create a supportive space for learners and contributors, no matter your background or skill level.

## Keep It Cool

To make this a great place to learn:
- Be friendly, patient, and encouraging.
- Welcome diverse ideas and questions—no such thing as a dumb one!
- Share feedback kindly and take it with a grin.
- Admit mistakes, learn, and keep exploring.

Not cool:
- Snarky comments, trolling, or putting others down.
- Inappropriate or off-topic behavior.
- Sharing private info without consent.
- Anything that makes learning less fun or inclusive.

## Where It Applies

This applies to all repo spaces—issues, PRs, discussions—and when you’re repping our project elsewhere (like forums or social media).

## Got a Problem?

See something off? Reach out to our maintainers at marwan13223@gmail.com. We’ll handle it quickly, fairly, and privately.

## Keeping Things Friendly

If someone’s vibe is off, we’ll:
1. **Gentle Reminder**: Private note to correct minor issues.
2. **Warning**: Heads-up for repeated slip-ups, with a break from interactions.
3. **Time-Out**: Short ban for bigger issues.
4. **Parting Ways**: Permanent ban for serious or ongoing problems.
